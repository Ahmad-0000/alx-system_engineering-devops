# Configuration Management
## Description
**Configuration Management** can be defined as "**the process of systemic
handling of changes in a system in a way that ensures integrity over
time**.", however, this term is broadly used for "**Server Configuration
Management**". There are some tools used for automation of these
processes to facilitate the whole process.

In this project I will focus on learning "**Puppet**", which is a server
configuration management tool, particularly on learning on how to
write automation configuration files (called "**Manifests**" regarding
puppet) to configure system components.
