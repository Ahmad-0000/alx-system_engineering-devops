# SSH
# Description
**SSH** (secure shell) is a protocol commmonly used to connect to
**Linux** servers over a network. It is very secure as it imployes
**"ssh keys"** as an authentication method between the clients and
hosts.

In today's project, I will connect to a remote server provided
to me in the **ALX Software Engineering Program** doing some basic
server management stuff as a beginning to learn more in **devops**,
**system administration** and **cloud computing**.
